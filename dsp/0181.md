# Portable experiences interface for the SDK

The interface would be included from the SDK using the identifier

```typescript
import * as PortableExperiences from '@decentraland/PortableExperiences'
```

```typescript

type PortableExperienceHandle = {
  pid: string
  // ???
}

export interface IPortableExperiencesController {
  /**
   * Creates a portable experience.
   * @param  {???} [data] - Information to identify the PE
   */
  spawn(data: ???): Promise<PortableExperienceHandle>

  /**
   * Kills a portable experience.
   * It receives the pid from a PortableExperienceHandle.
   *
   * Only the scene that spawned the portable experience has permission to kill it.
   */
  kill(pid: string): Promise<???>
}
```
