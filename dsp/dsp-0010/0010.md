## Introduction

Every parcel in Decentraland's world is represented by a non-fungible token ERC #721 that is indivisible and unique. This registry is powered by a smart contract where it is defined all the information related to each parcel.

## Abstract

Decentraland's most important digital asset is its LAND token. The world is divided into square parcels of LAND that act similarly to a domain name: the owner of a LAND can decide what to show inside the 3D experience, in very much the same way as the owner of "example.com" can decide what webpage to show when a browser connects to that domain.

The LAND token exists within a EVM blockchain (currently Ethereum). Decentraland is one of the first examples of the ERC 721 "NFT" token (the standard explicitly cites Decentraland and CryptoPunks as the first projects to experiment with this idea).

This document describes the structure, and the expected behavior and functionality of interacting components provided by the LAND contract also known as LANDRegistry contract.

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC 8174](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8174) when, and only when, they appear in all capitals, as shown here.

## Compatibility

LAND is compliant with the [ERC721 Ethereum standard](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-721.md), and implements the [ERC721Base interface](https://github.com/decentraland/erc721/blob/master/contracts/IERC721Base.sol), as well as the [ERC721Enumerable interface](https://github.com/decentraland/erc721/blob/master/contracts/IERC721Enumerable.sol).

Its implementation could be find [here](https://github.com/decentraland/land/blob/master/full/LANDRegistry.sol).

## Terminology

**Parcel**: the logical unit of land subdivision in the Decentraland's world. Each parcel may contain metadata formerly used to save its content.

**LAND**: a brand name for parcels.

**Coordinates**: x, y representation of the parcel.

**Asset Id**: token id of the parcel generated by encoding the x and y coordinates.

**Estate**: a group of parcels placed together.

**Account**: an Ethereum address

## Design

### Coordinates

The coordinates of a LAND parcel are its X and Y coordinates, using 128 bits to represent the (signed) coordinate.

The following are examples of coordinates:


| X  | Y   | 256-bit Hexadecimal Representation |
|----|-----|---|
| 0  |  0  | 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000 |
| -1 |  0  | 0xffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff00000000000000000000000000000000 |
| 1  | -1  | 0x00000000000000000000000000000001ffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff |
| -1 | 150 | 0xffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff00000000000000000000000000000096 |
| 0  | 90  | 0x000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000005a |
| 150| 150 | 0x0000000000000000000000000000009600000000000000000000000000000096 |


### Contract

This contract was created using a [proxy pattern](https://blog.openzeppelin.com/proxy-patterns/) which allows upgradability.

### Roles

#### Proxy owner

The account owner of the LAND proxy contract.

#### Contract owner

The account owner of the LAND registry contract.

#### AuthorizedDeployer

Account allowed to create new parcels.

#### Owner

Account which is the owner of a specific parcel.

#### ApprovedForAll

Account which plays as a co-owner for all the parcels owned by another account. An account can has multiple ApprovedForAll

#### Operator

Account which plays as a co-owner for a specific parcel. A parcel can has only one Operator.

#### UpdateManager

Account that can update the parcel metadata of all of the parcels owned by another account. An account can has multiple UpdateManager

#### UpdateOperator

Account **only** allowed to update the parcel metadata. A parcel can has only one UpdateOperator.

### Parcel Metadata

Every parcel has metadata which is used to represent its content (scene). The metadata has the following structure:

_`version,name,description,ipns`_

- Version: number of the metadata version.
- Name: Parcel name.
- Description: Parcel description.
- IPNS: ipns hash link to the parcel scene.

E.g: _`0,"My parcel","Description",""`_

### Dead Ping

To be defined.

## Limitations

As blocklimit limitation, every transaction which support `many` parcels manipulation may _run out of gas_. It is strongly recommended to divide the transaction in multiple ones to achieve the same.

From the above `landOf` and `tokensOf` may not work if the account is owner of more than 20 parcels.
