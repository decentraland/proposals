# GLTF Models and Animations


## Introduction

All 3D models in Decentraland must be in glTF format. [glTF](https://www.khronos.org/gltf) (GL Transmission Format) is an open project by Khronos providing a common, extensible format for 3D assets that is both efficient and highly interoperable with modern web technologies.



## Abstract



## Terminology

**3D Model**:

**Mesh**:

**Material**:

**Texture**:

**Animation**:

**Collider**:


## About GLTF

glTF models can have either a _.gltf_ or a _.glb_ extension. glTF files are human-readable, you can open one in a text editor and read it like a JSON file. This is useful, for example, to verify that animations are properly attached and to check for their names. glb files are binary, so they're not readable but they are considerably smaller in size, which is good for the scene's performance.

> Tip: We recommend using _.gltf_ while you're working on a scene, but then switching to _.glb_ when uploading it to Decentraland.

The following aspects of a 3D model can either be embedded in a _glTF_ file or referenced externally:

- Textures can either be embedded or referenced from an external image file.
- Binary data about geometry, animations, and other buffer-related aspects of the model can either be embedded or referenced from an external _.bin_ file.

> Note: Animations _must_ be embedded inside the _glTF_ file to use in Decentraland.

### Add a GLTF model to an entity

To import a GLTF model into a Decentraland scene using TypeScript, create a new *Entity* and add a `GLTFShape` component to that entity. This positions the 3D model in your scene, using the position, rotation, and scale of the entity. The scene now includes the meshes, materials, and colliders of the 3D model.

Animations are handled separately, as explained in a further section.


## Materials

#### Shader support

Only the following shaders can be used in models that are imported into Decentraland:

- Standard materials: any shaders are supported, for example diffuse, specular, transparency, etc.

  > Tip: When using Blender, these are the materials supported by _Blender Render_ rendering.

- PBR (Physically Based Rendering) materials: This shader is extremely flexible, as it includes properties like diffuse, roughness, metalness and emission that allow you to configure how a material interacts with light.

  > Tip: When using Blender, you can use PBR materials by setting _Cycles_ rendering and adding the _Principled BSDF_ shader. Note that none of the other shaders of the _Cycles_ renderer are supported.

You can configure a material to be _transparent_. Transparent materials can be seen through to varying degrees, depending on their _alpha_. 

You can also make a material _emissive_. Emissive materials cast their own light. Note that when rendered, they don't actually illuminate nearby objects in the scene, they just seem to have a blurred glow around them.


#### Textures

Textures can be embedded into a glTF file or referenced from an external file. Both ways are supported.

Texture sizes must use width and height numbers (in pixels) that match the following numbers:

```
1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512
```

This sequence is made up of powers of two: `f(x) = 2 ^ x` . 512 is the maximum number we allow for a texture size. This is a fairly common requirement among other rendering engines, it's there due internal optimizations of the graphics processors.

The width and height don't need to have the same number, but they both need to belong to this sequence.

## Meshes

3D models have a _mesh_ composed of triangular _faces_. These faces meet each other on _edges_ (the lines along which they touch) and _vertices_ (the points where their corners join).

### Scene limits

All 3D models in your scene must fit within the limits of its parcels. For performance reasons, Decentraland checks the positions of the _bounding boxes_ around meshes (not the vertices in the meshes themselves) to verify that they are within the scene's limits. 

If you have a model that has all of its vertices neatly inside the scene area, but that has large bounding boxes that are mostly empty and extend beyond the scene limits, the entire model will be marked as outside the scene limits.

To avoid this problem, you can clean up your 3D models to reset positions and rotations of meshes so that bounding boxes don't extend beyond the meshes they wrap.


### Smooth geometries

You can configure a mesh to be _smooth_. This tells the engine to render its shape as if there was an infinite number of intermediate faces rounding it off. This setting can greatly help you reduce the number of triangles needed to make a shape appear to be rounded.

This setting can be configured separately over individual _faces_, _edges_ and _vertices_ of a model. One same model could have some of its faces or edges set to _smooth_ and others to _sharp_

## Colliders

To enable collisions between a 3D model and users of Decentraland, you must create a new mesh to serve as a collider. Without a collider, users are able to walk through models as if they weren't there. For performance reasons, colliders usually have a much simpler geometry than the model itself.

Colliders currently don't affect how models and entities interact with each other, they can always overlap. Colliders only affect how the model interacts with the user's avatar.

For an object to be recognized by a Decentraland scene as a collider, all it needs is to be named in a certain way. The object's name must include the the suffix “\_collider” at the end.

For example, to create a collider for a tree, you can create a simple box object surrounding its trunk. Users of the scene won't see this box, but it will block their path.


## Animations

3D models in _.glTF_ and _.glb_ format can include as many animations as you want in them. Animations tell the mesh how to move, by specifying a series of _keyframes_ that are laid out over time, the mesh then blends from one pose to the other to simulate continuous movement. 

Most 3D model animations are [_skeletal animations_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skeletal_animation). These animations simplify the complex geometry of the model into a "stick figure", linking every vertex in the mesh to the closest _bone_ in the _skeleton_. Modelers adjust the skeleton into different poses, and the mesh stretches and bends to follow these movements.

As an alternative, _vertex animations_ animate a model without the need of a skeleton. These animations specify the position of each vertex in the model directly. Decentraland supports these animations as well.

> Tip: Animations are usually better for moving something in place, not for changing the position of an entity. For example, you can set an animation to move a character's feet in place, but to change the location of the entity it's best to change the position of the entity.

There's no specific rule about the names animations must have. You can verify the names of the animations in an exported model by opening the contents of a _.gltf_ file with a text editor. Typically, an animation name is comprised of its armature name, an underscore and its animation name. For example `myArmature_animation1`.

> Tip: Instead of creating your own animations, you can also download generic animations and apply them to your model. For example, for 3D characters with human-like characteristics, you can download free or paid animations from [Mixamo](https://www.mixamo.com/#/).

### Add animations to an entity

In the TypeScript code of a scene, an `Animator` component manages all the animations of the entity. Each animation is handled by an `AnimationClip` object.

To animate an entity, you must add both a `GLTFShape` component and an `Animator` component to that entity, and the Animator must reference at least one `AnimationClip` object.

The `AnimationClip` object doesn't store the actual transformations that go into the animation, that's all in the .glTF file. Instead, the `AnimationClip` object has a state that keeps track how far it has advanced along the animation.

### Animation functions

You can control an animation by running the following functions on an `AnimationClip` object:

- *play* to start playing the animation
- *pause* to freeze an animation at the frame it's in
- *stop* to freeze an animation and return it to the first frame
- *reset* to return to the first frame, and start playing from there


### Configure animations

You can configure several aspects of how an animation is played in a scene, by setting the following parameters in an `AnimationClip` object:

**Loop**

By default, animations are played in a loop that keeps repeating the animation forever.
If `looping` is set to _false_, the animation plays just once and then stops.


**Speed**

You can change the speed at which an animation is played. The value of the speed is 1 by default. Set the speed lower than 1 to play it slower, for example to 0.5 to play it at half the speed. Set it higher than 1 to play it faster, for example to 2 to play it at double the speed.

**Weight**

You can change the weight with which an animation is played. This allows a single model to carry out multiple animations at once, calculating a weighted average of all the movements involved in the animation. The value of the weight determines how much importance that animation will be given in the average. 

By default, the weight is equal to _1_, it can't be any higher than _1_.

The `weight` value of all active animations in an entity should add up to 1 at all times. If it adds up to less than 1, the weighted average will be using the default position of the armature for the remaining part of the calculation.


## Rationale for using GLTF


Compared to the older _OBJ format_, which supports only vertices, normals, texture coordinates, and basic materials,
glTF provides a more powerful set of features that includes:

- Hierarchical objects
- Skeletal structure and animation
- More robust materials and shaders
- Scene information (light sources, cameras)

Compared to _COLLADA_, the supported features are very similar. However, because glTF focuses on providing a
"transmission format" rather than an editor format, it is more interoperable with web technologies.

Consider this analogy: the .PSD (Adobe Photoshop) format is helpful for editing 2D images, but images must then be converted to .JPG for use
on the web. In the same way, COLLADA may be used to edit a 3D asset, but glTF is a simpler way of transmitting it while rendering the same result.
