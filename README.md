# Decentraland VR Visions Content Proposals
We are rewarding community members who propose and create content for Decentraland for our upcoming token sale. We have reserved 700,000 MANA tokens (1,000 MANA can be swapped for 1 plot of LAND) for people who submit thoughtful content proposals for Decentraland.

## Qualifying Proposals
To be deemed as a 'qualifying proposal' the following conditions must be met:
* The proposal was submitted as an issue in the [decentraland/proposals](https://github.com/decentraland/proposals) repository
* The proposed content adheres to the [Content Proposal Standard template](#content-proposal-standard)

## Content Proposal Standard
The Content Proposal Standard is a template for proposals designed to ensure that submissions have been well-reviewed and contain a sufficient number of supporting details for us to judge the quality and fit. All proposals should be structured as follows:

###### Tier 1
**Name**: the name of the proposed content

**Description**: includes Unity 3D models that can currently go inside Decentraland

###### Tier 2
**Name**: the name of the proposed content

**Purpose**: the purpose of the proposed content (ex: casino, game, art structure, museum, club, office tower)

**Description**: describe the content in detail (can provide drafts of images, layout, tiles of land needed, etc.)

## Proposal Incentives
To incentivize the submission of thoughtful Decentraland proposals, the following rewards will be issued:

* Tier 1 = 1000 MANA
* Tier 2 = 5000 MANA

Note: Proposal incentive reward amounts are subject to change in the event of abuse of the system
